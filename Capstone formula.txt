Obtain distances from 3+ anchors
Find intersection points for the circle made by each anchor's distance circle
Sort distances between intersections
Remove outliers (Anything with 3x the median data point)
Triangulate midpoint of intersections
Generate a reference frame of a circle around the midpoint using pre-calculated margin of error
Compare kinect data to this reference frame
