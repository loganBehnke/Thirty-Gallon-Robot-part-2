  max_vel_x: 0.45 #The maximum forward velocity allowed for the base in meters/sec
  min_vel_x: 0.1 #The minimum forward velocity allowed for the base in meters/sec. It is useful to specify this to guarantee that velocity commands sent to a mobile base are high enough to allow the base to overcome friction.
  max_vel_theta: 1.0 #The maximum rotational velocity allowed for the base in radians/sec
  min_in_place_vel_theta: 0.4 #The minimum rotational velocity allowed for the base while performing in-place rotations in radians/sec

  acc_lim_theta: 3.2 #The rotational acceleration limit of the robot in radians/sec^2
  acc_lim_x: 2.5 #The x acceleration limit of the robot in meters/sec^2
  acc_lim_y: 2.5 #The y acceleration limit of the robot in meters/sec^2

  holonomic_robot: false
  #Determines whether velocity commands are generated for a holonomic or non-holonomic robot. For holonomic robots, strafing velocity commands may be issued to the base. For non-holonomic robots, no strafing velocity commands will be issued.
